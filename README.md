# Face2Face
Automating the attendance system 
*Face recognition attendance system is becoming increasingly popular inthe workplace, as it provides a more efficient and accurate method fortracking attendance compared to traditional methods.
* Face recognition attendance systems work by using cameras to capturethe unique features of an employee's face, which are then compared to a preexisting database of facial images and matches the image in the database, theirattendance is recorded.
* There are many previous solutions back from 1990â€™s to recently 2020 some are Eigenfaces, Local Binary Patterns ,Convolutional Neural Networks,Deep Learning and many more.
* Improved accuracy and efficiency to reduce fraud and improve privacy. So theBest choice is Deep Metric Learning (machine learning algorithm).
* Deep Metric Learning is used to learn a metric space where data points thatare similar are mapped close to each other, and dissimilar data points aremapped far apart.
* Accuracy achieved by training the algorithm on a large dataset of face images and optimizing the network parameters to minimize a distance metric betweenpairs of images .
* The trained network is then used to compute feature vectors for new images,and these feature vectors are compared to a database of known feature vectorsto determine the identity of the person in the image.
* Overall, the use of Deep Metric Learning algorithms will show promising resultsin improving the accuracy of face recognition attendance systems, making them more reliable and efficient in real-world applications.
